## GOED announces tax credits for rural businesses

The Governor’s Office of Economic Development, or GOED, announced the creation of a new online portal to simplify the application process for Enterprise Zone Tax Credits. The tax credits incentivize investment and job creation by rural, non-retail small businesses in Utah.

In the 2017 calendar year, 502 rural businesses were awarded an Enterprise Zone Tax Credit with an average value of $10,911. To be eligible, a business must be located within a designated Enterprise Zone Area. To see if a business is located within an Enterprise Zone Area, visit www.locate.utah.gov and select “Enterprise Zones” under the Economy tab.

“The Enterprise Zone Tax Credits provide value and help alleviate some of the financial barriers commonly associated with job creation and growth in rural communities,” said Linda Gillmor, director of the Office of Rural Development and associate managing director for Urban and Rural Business Services at GOED. “We have a number of tax credit programs available to rural businesses. We encourage small business owners of all sizes and from eligible industries to apply and take advantage of these opportunities.”
