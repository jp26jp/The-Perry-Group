Six important things for first time home buyers to consider when purchasing a home in Salt Lake City. 

## Location

Where do you want to live? Location is always something that we heavily stress to our buyers. The ONE thing that cannot be changed after you purchase your home is the location. Do you love the house but hate the place? We understand that all situations are different, but if you have the ability to pick the area do not sacrifice it. Drive the neighborhood, feel out the local events, and imagine yourself in your new community. Our goal is always to find you your forever home.

## NEEDS NOT WANTS 

I️ had a tough time not placing this atop of this article. Do you have three kids? Do you have two kids? This will affect the bathroom count that you want. Bedrooms are critical.  The idea of kids sharing bunk beds sounds fantastic until they get older. Trust me, my parents thought it was a good idea until they tried it. 

## Ability to change your home

It’s human nature wanting to better the place you live in. No, you don’t need a general contractor coming in telling you what can be changed, but envision a layout. Can walls be taken down? Bathrooms be improved? Ability for an outdoor patio? From experience, I️ often find every time I️ revisit with my buyers the home looks a little different, a little better. 

## Investment

Study the charts and analyze the grids. Specific areas and zip codes tend to spike, while other zip codes take less of a hit when the market “crashes”. This goes along with location, do the surrounding homes look nice? Homes being updated and remodeled on your street brings significant value to your own property. 

## What is sweat equity?

Being able to get on your hands and knees and enhancing your house by yourself. This does not mean do everything yourself. BUT! You can make your yard look appealing, change the carpet, upgrade your bathroom, enhance the fixtures and for the more handy people some of you can completely upgrade your home alone!

## Be active

Be active in your search. We have a group of four realtors who routinely will make offers on the same property with different clients. OUCH!! Can’t imagine the other million realtors in SLC. Look every day, every hour. Or get a realtor who will do the work for you! One last tip for you.  We continuously preach this term “if you have to sleep on it, you won’t sleep in it.” Best of luck to you! With that said......Your fate will be a little better if you hire us:)
