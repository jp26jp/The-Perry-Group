description: With my grandfather and uncle being real estate agents for over 30 years, I have always had a love for houses + people. Being part of the Perry Group, I have access to over 15 years of real estate experience. A little bit about me - I grew up in Pennsylvania, received my BBA in Virginia, and have been in Utah for 2 years. I love this state + city and am beyond blessed to call it my home. Give me a call or text and let me help you make Utah your new home!
