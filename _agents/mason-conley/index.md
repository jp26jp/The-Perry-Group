description: Real estate has been a dream of mine ever since I started high school. My love for it started as soon as I helped my Grandparents with a flip. My family has been in real estate for years now, and I am so grateful to have the chance to begin my career with it. Spending most of my life in Utah has really made me appreciate what this beautiful state has to offer. The Perry Group has been the greatest decision to be a part of. Being in a group with over 15 years of experience has given me the knowledge and confidence to put my clients in the best positions possible to get a deal and a great property. Please call or text me if you are wanting to explore the option of getting yourself into a home!
