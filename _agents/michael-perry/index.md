description: I grew up in Sugar House and have fallen in love with SLC. I truly believe Salt Lake City is becoming one of the top destinations in the world. This city is changing, and the culture is vibrant. Going to all of the local schools Beacon Heights/ Hillside/ Judge Memorial and then to the University I have been able to gather a sense of knowledge that most people seek out. I love this place, and I love this city. Make SLC your new home!
